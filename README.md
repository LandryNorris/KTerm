Shell Editor
============

Shell frontend for Jetpack Compose. This
allows apps to include a full terminal. Note
that actually running the shell scripts is
outside the scope of this, since this project 
is just a frontend.

Platforms
---------

Currently only desktop, but others will be 
added when the prototype is done.
